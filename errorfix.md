# Routing Error Fix Documentation

## Problem Description
The application was showing "404 Page Not Found" errors when trying to navigate to protected routes like `/timesheet-entry`, even though the routes appeared to be properly configured.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was with how authentication protection was implemented in the routing system. The original `ProtectedRoute` component wrapped `Route` components inside a higher-order component, which broke wouter's routing mechanism.

**Technical Details:**
- Wouter's `Switch` component expects direct `Route` children
- When `Route` components are wrapped inside other components (like `ProtectedRoute`), the `Switch` cannot find them during route matching
- This is different from React Router, where nested route structures are more flexible

## Solution Steps Taken

### Step 1: Created ProtectedPage Component
- Created `client/src/lib/protected-page.tsx`
- Moved authentication logic from route-level to page-level
- Component handles loading states and authentication redirects

### Step 2: Updated App.tsx Routing Structure
- Replaced `ProtectedRoute` components with direct `Route` components
- Wrapped page components with `ProtectedPage` instead of wrapping routes
- Changed structure from: `Switch > ProtectedRoute > Route > Page` to: `Switch > Route > ProtectedPage > Page`

### Step 3: Removed Old ProtectedRoute Component
- Deleted references to the old `ProtectedRoute` component
- Updated imports to use `ProtectedPage` instead

## Code Changes Made

1. **New file:** `client/src/lib/protected-page.tsx`
2. **Modified:** `client/src/App.tsx` - Updated routing structure
3. **Deprecated:** `client/src/lib/protected-route.tsx` (no longer used)

## Verification
After implementing these changes:
- All protected routes should be accessible
- Authentication logic still works correctly
- Users are redirected to `/auth` when not logged in
- Loading states display properly during authentication checks

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If the error persists after this fix:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Hard refresh the browser or clear cache
2. **Check Network Tab:** Verify no 404 errors for route requests
3. **Verify Imports:** Ensure all page components are properly imported
4. **Check Console:** Look for any React or JavaScript errors
5. **Test Direct Navigation:** Try navigating directly to URLs vs using nav links
6. **Verify Wouter Version:** Ensure wouter is properly installed and compatible

## Prevention
- Always test routing changes in development
- Use wouter's expected patterns for route protection
- Consider using route-level authentication hooks instead of wrapper components for wouter
- Test both direct URL navigation and programmatic navigation
